I dont have specific knowledge of the ROM chips on the Arduino, but many ROMs have the ability of spreading read and write cycles across the chip. The effect of this is that when even some memory locations degrade, it is a sign that the entire chip will degrade soon. Even if the R/W cycles are not spread, even then, if certain areas start to fail, then it is a sign that.." CreationDate="2014-02-13T15:31:04.303" UserId="65" />

Well, the Uno didn't like the optiboot running on 56200 bps (not sure why), but the Severino and my custom boards with serial FTDI-like programming headers all worked. I also couldn't compile the optiboot slower than that (tried 19200) because other compile errors, but that's ok. I used Arduino IDE 1.0.5 and followed the instructions on .\hardware\arduino\bootloaders\optiboot\README.TXT and didn't have to install anything beyond the IDE. Nice!!"

A direct short will overload the power supply and trip the protection circuit on the power supply, causing the whole Arduino to shut down. You want a resistor of high enough impedance to keep the current flow low. I usually use a 100k resistor, which is plenty to pull the input signal to 0 volts when the switch is open, and only allows .00005 pas to flow, a trivial amount of current. A 10k resistor works too, but that allows 10 times as much current to flow." CreationDate="2014-07-06T20:09:56.553" UserId="2967" />

If that is really a 24v motor, it's probably going to be disappointing in performance (usually one uses a motor having a coil rated for a few volts, with a chopping current drive with many times that in available supply voltage).  While it's really AC impedance (inductance) that you need to worry about for performance, what do you measure as the DC resistance of a coil?" CreationDate="2014-09-08T19:18:47.163" UserId="612" />

I've been studying transistors, but I think I need to study a bit more : )&#xA;&#xA;re: PWM - I should have been more specific that these are LED lights.  It is a 12v line but the bulb itself has a few LEDs on it - (I'm not sure exactly how its internals are set up).  But it seems transistors are the way to go.&#xA;&#xA;The goal with the PWM is to reduce brightness." CreationDate="2014-09-13T20:46:49.673" UserId="3964" />
  <row Id="9206" PostId="4181" Score="0" Text="Okay. You can use PWM to reduce the apparent brightness of the LEDs. You still need to use the full voltage to calculate the current limiting resistor though (e.g. LED forward voltage = 1.2 volts. Supply voltage = 12 volts. desired LED current = 20 mA.  resistor value = (12-1.2)/.02= 540 ohms.Then PWM control varies the duty cycle of the LED, which changes the **apparent** brightness. (I say apparent because what really happens is the LED flashes between on and off too rapidly for our eyes to see, so our eyes average the total light output over time.)"

If a pwm is flashing at 50hz... is there any factor in limiting the transistor to 'keep up' ?" CreationDate="2014-09-14T02:53:41.860" UserId="3964" />
